# Java-Task
Project Title: Even or Odd Number Checker 

Objective
The goal of this task was to create a simple Java console application. This application allows a user to input an integer. The program then checks whether the number is even or odd. The task is designed to introduce fundamental concepts like conditional logic and modulus arithmetic in Java.


Key Concepts Used
User Input: The program needed to handle user input. The 
Scanner class is typically used for this purpose in Java.
Modulus Operator (%): This operator was used to determine if a number is even or odd. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 (num%2==0), it is an even number.
If-Else Statements: Conditional logic was implemented using an if-else statement to display the correct result based on the modulus operation.

How to Run the Application
Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Compile the Java file using a command-line terminal or your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
Run the application. The program will prompt you to enter a number.
Enter an integer, and the program will tell you if the number is even or odd.
